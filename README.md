# PBWT-Tunneling
## Makefile
`generate_haplotypes`\
It generates haplotypes with help of [Macs](https://code.google.com/archive/p/macs/) project. In order to run this you have to download [Macs](https://code.google.com/archive/p/macs/) and setup it. After that, you need to set `MACS_PATH` variable in `Makefile`.
